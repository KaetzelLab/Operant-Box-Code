#--------------------------5-CSRTT Protocol Task File----------------------

# cue presentation ==> Correct response       ==> reward(@reward port)      ==> iti** ==> cue presentation
# cue presentation ==> Incorrect response     ==> penalty (house light off) ==> iti** ==> cue presentation
# cue presentation ==> omission (no response) ==> penalty (house light off) ==> iti** ==> cue presentation
# **any response at 5-Poke during the iti is considered as premature response and trial starts again after penalty(house light off)

# Important readouts:
# Responses :- number of Corrects, number of Incorrects, number of Omissions, number of Prematures
# Latencies :-Reward lat., Premature lat., Correct lat.,

# important note:- if reward port SOL not used and intended to use 'house_light = Digital_output(pin=board.port_5.POW_A)'
#  ....then this line of code 'hw.reward_port.SOL.on()'  need to modify as 'hw.house_light.on()' to control HouseLight
