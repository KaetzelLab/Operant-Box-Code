#------------------------------poke_habituation protcol--------------------
#Task file for 5-CSRTT habituation, task starts with reward and trial starts by presenting all light
#...of the five-choice light on for undefined time any poke at five_choice give reward
# important note:- Do not change any print stings if you intended to use pyOS5 GUI
#reward ==> five choice all lights on====> rescponse at five poke ==> reward
#Important readouts:
#Responses :- #Correct_response (can also rename as Responses )
