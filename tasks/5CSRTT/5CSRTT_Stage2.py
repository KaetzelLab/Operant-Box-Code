#--------------------------5-CSRTT Protocol----------------------
# important note:- Do not change any print stings if you intended to use pyOS5 GUI
# Task file for 5-CSRTT task which can be used for training stages 1-5, and all challanges, by adjusting task variables as described below. 

# One of the five_poke LEDs turns on randomly (cue presentation) and subject has to make response within the specified period of time(SD+LH)
# cue presentation ==> Correct poke (illuminated hole)                  ==> reward(@reward port)      ==> iti** ==> cue presentation
# cue presentation ==> Incorrect response (other than illuminated hole) ==> penalty (house light off) ==> iti** ==> cue presentation
# cue presentation ==> omission (no response)                           ==> penalty (house light off) ==> iti** ==> cue presentation
 
# Important readouts:
# Responses :- number of Corrects, number of Incorrects, number of Omissions, number of Prematures
# Latencies :-Reward lat., Premature lat., Correct lat.,

# If Subject made criteria for two consecutive days, then task can be advanced to stage-1 to satge-2 and so on upto stage-5.
# Detailed description and criteria list is provided in the manuscript 

# VARIABLES CHANGED ACROSS TRAINING STAGES AND CHALLANGES

# Stage 1: v.state_dur = 20 *second , v.ITI_dur = 2 *second
# Stage 2: v.state_dur = 8 *second  , v.ITI_dur = 2 *second
# Stage 3: v.state_dur = 8 *second  , v.ITI_dur = 5 *second
# Stage 4  v.state_dur = 4 *second  , v.ITI_dur = 5 *second
# Stage 5: v.state_dur = 2 *second  , v.ITI_dur = 5 *second

# Attention Challenge 1000ms : v.state_dur = 1 *second    , v.ITI_dur = 5 *second
# Attention Challenge 800ms  : v.state_dur = 0.8 *second  , v.ITI_dur = 5 *second
# FixedITI Challenge         : v.state_dur = 2 *second    , v.ITI_dur = 9 *second
# VariableITI challange      : v.variable_ITI = True
# Sound distraction challange: v.sound_distraction = True
